# Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet
## Front-End Engineer Path - Improved Styling with CSS

___

### Project Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, **Codecademy**, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

___

### Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like **Codecademy**, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.

### Project Requirements

`1.` Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our [example project](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/html-css-cheat-sheet/example/index.html?_gl=1*ul7a48*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MjExMTU5MDEuQ2p3S0NBand0TmkwQmhBMUVpd0FXWmFBTkhjSnBIQnJBZEd1dGVPUG5laFpwaVdjaXhUcmJYSXkwS3VXTTE0RVV6Y2RodnhrbmwtaHZSb0N1X0lRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTU4MDYwOTc5MC4xNzIwNjA0ODU4*_ga*MTc4MTczMjIzMC4xNzIxMTE1MTc5*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTcyMTkwMTg3Ny4zNC4xLjE3MjE5MTM5NjQuMS4wLjA.), we documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so far—the sky is the limit!

Possible topics could be:

- HTML Tables
- Other HTML tags
- CSS selectors and specificity
- Common CSS properties

If you choose to document HTML tags, open the hint to see how to include HTML tags as text in your code.

####

`2.` Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label the columns in your HTML.

In our example site, we used tables with columns for:

- The tag or attribute name
- The actual formatted tag (eg. `<table>`)
- A description of what to use the tag for.

You can use these same columns or choose your own.

####

`3.` Your site should utilize a custom color scheme. You can use any of the [named CSS colors](https://147colors.com/).

####

`4.` Your site should use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags (like `<h1>`) or CSS properties or values (like font-family). Represent code using a monospace font family and a different background color.
